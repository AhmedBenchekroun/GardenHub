# GardenHub
GardenHub is a work in progress web application designed to facilitate community garden management. It is being developed in the open and it's licensed under AGPL-3.0+. It's written in Python using the Django framework. You can preview our work on the demo site shown above, but keep in mind that it will change dramatically.

Eventually, the inner-workings of this project will documented in detail. For now, you're welcome to chat with us by opening a GitHub issue. GardenHub is a project by HarvestHub, and it's being developed by Candlewaster.
